# isopretGO

Isoform Interpretation (isopret) with Gene Ontology (isopretGO) is Java desktop application to 
visualize the functional implications of differential gene expression and differential alternative splicing
in RNA-seq data. isopretGO leverages isoform-specific functional (GO) annotations presented in
[Karlebach G, et al. (2023) Bioinformatics 39:btad132](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36929917/)
for an approach towards GO overrepresentation analysis of differential transcripts, and presents
a graphicual user interface (GUI) application to perform the analysis and explore the results.

See the [online documentation](https://thejacksonlaboratory.github.io/isopretGO/) for installation and usage instructions.


interpret the potential biological  functions that are affected by differential alternative splicing. Isopret is
available as a Java desktop application. Most users should download the latest version from the
Releases page.

A manuscript is in preparation.
