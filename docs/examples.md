# Example input files for isopret


RNA-Seq datasets were obtained from NCBI's [Sequence Read Archive (SRA)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra).
These experiments study a broad range of conditons, but they all contained two distinct sets of
samples that could be compared in a case-control design.

A zip archive containing HBADEALS output files for each of the datasets can be obtained
from the zenodo archive  at [10369086](https://zenodo.org/records/10369086){:target="_blanl"}.

Details and PubMed identifiers for each of the experiments are available in the Supplementary material. 

- Supplemental table S1: 33 disease-related cohorts
- Supplemental table S2: 28 RNA-seq experiments devoted primarily to the study of physiology, gene expression or cell biology.
- Supplemental table S3: 39 RNA-seq experiments devoted primarily to the study of cancer
- Supplemental table S4: 5 RNA-seq experiments related to infectious disease.


Additionally, the GitHub repository for the paper [Betacoronavirus-specific alternate splicing](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35074468/)
also contains 15 HBA-DEALS output files related to that publication that can be used as input for isopretGO.
