Isopret: Isoform interpretation
===============================

Isopret is a Java application for investigating overrepresentation of
`Gene Ontology (GO) <http://geneontology.org/>`_ annotations in differentially spliced or
differentially expressed genes.

Isopret uses the analysis (output) file of
`HBA-DEALS <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32660516/>`_. HBA-DEALS
analyzes RNA-Seq data to determine differentially expression and differential
splicing simultaneous. Isopret then performs
Gene Ontology analysis using a Java 17 implementation of code from
the `Ontologizer <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18511468/>`_.
